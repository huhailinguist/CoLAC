# CoLAC: Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability for Chinese


We present Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability in Chinese (CoLAC), the first large-scale  acceptability dataset in a non-Indo-European language handcrafted by linguists to evaluate the grammatical proficiency of language models. Our dataset consists of 7,495 sentences collected from one syntax textbook, one linguistics handbook, and 68 linguistics journal articles, all verified by native speakers of Mandarin. 

Every example sentence has two labels:

1) **label0**: a single label from the linguist who proposed the example (Note that this label is not from a single linguist, as we collected examples from one syntax textbook, one handbook for Chinese syntax and about 70 journal articles authored by different theoretical syntacticians), which we call **linguist label**,

2) **label1**: a **crowd label**, mapped from the mean ratings from other native speakers of Mandarin Chinese.
